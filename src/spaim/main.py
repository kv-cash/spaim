Hi Jim,

I hope you’re doing well! I’ve been following ABC’s recent push into cloud services and was impressed by the speed and scale at which you’re delivering new features. As a partner that builds security solutions specifically for teams like yours, I’d love to share how we can help keep those deployments safe—without slowing down your developers.

Why Our Solution Aligns with Your Cloud‑First Strategy
What You Need	How We Deliver
Zero‑Trust protection across multi‑cloud environments	Continuous identity verification, least‑privilege access, and automated policy enforcement that work natively in AWS, Azure, GCP, and hybrid setups.
All of this is available on our portal, which you can access right now at acme.co/portal.

A Quick Win for Your Team
We’re offering a 30‑day free sandbox that lets your developers experiment in a production‑like environment—no commitments, no data exposure. After the trial, we’ll provide a personalized assessment and migration roadmap if you decide to adopt fully.

Would you be open to a 20‑minute call next week to walk through a demo? I’m happy to adjust the time to fit your schedule.

Looking forward to exploring how we can secure ABC’s cloud journey together.

Best regards,

Joe Smith
